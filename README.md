**Updated versions of the mod for newer versions of the game will come out.
Please be patient, and wait for the updates.**
 
**Essential Additions** is a simple Minecraft mod, adding what many people suggest should be in the Vanilla game. While it does not add any new properties or elements to the game, it adds a few things planned by Mojang *(Ruby Gems for example)* or requested by many people, but never added. It also adds a few crafting recipes for Vanilla items that were not previously obtainable from crafting. A few Vanilla items can now be used to make their respective armor and tool sets.
 
Suggestions can be sent in the issues section of the Curse page, or GitHub *(Preferably GitHub)*.
