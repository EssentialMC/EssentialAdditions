***THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY IN REWRITE STAGE!***

**Updated versions for newer versions of the game will come out.
Please be patient, and wait for the updates.
This is an old mod, which I have chosen to continue developing.**
 
**Essential Additions** is a simple Minecraft mod, adding to what many people suggest should be in the Vanilla game. While it does not add any new properties or elements to the game, it does add a few things planned by Mojang *(Ruby Gems for example)* or requested by many people, but never added. It adds a few crafting recipes to make Vanilla items while a few items from Vanilla are used to make their respective armor and tool sets.
 
Suggestions can be sent in the issues section of the Curse page, or GitHub *(Preferably GitHub)*.
